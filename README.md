**Question:**
What will be printed as a result and why?

**Answer:**
>Hi
>
>undefined

This (*=The context*) is a special keyword inside each function and its value depends on how the function was called. 
As a result, executed function is called with different context from setTimeout.

You can fix this by passing the right context with **bind**.
`setTimeout(test.echo.bind(test), 100)`
